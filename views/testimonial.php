                            <p class="text-left">My LG fridge stopped getting cold. It still ran, 
                                                 just not getting cold. The LG website said to contact 
                                                 Rescue My Appliances. Dmitri was professional and 
                                                 courteous and on time. It was a bad compressor...pricey fix 
                                                 but WAY better than buying a new fridge. Plus, Dmitri had 
                                                 a simple fix for the busted ice maker. I'm happy with this experience.</p>

                                                 i have used them several times as a property manager 
                                                 and each time I have found them to be timely, professional, 
                                                 and extremely communicative throughout the entire process! 
                                                 Their prices are fair. I highly recommend this company to 
                                                 anyone looking for appliance repairs!&nbsp;</p>

                            <p class="text-left ">I have used this company for years! They are reliable and honest. I recently had an issue with our dishwasher, an issue that Samsung could not figure out, and Rescue My Appliances did! He first called Samsung, and was not happy with their response. The technician that came out would not be satisfied until he had the answer. Now, my dishwasher works beautifully.
                              Over the years we have had our dishwasher, washing machine, dryer and garbage disposal repaired by Rescue My Appliances, all to our 100% satisfaction.
                              Our family highly recommends RMA!</p>
